**Dataset title:** Mole Crab Microplastic Dataset

**Dataset curator:** Nicky Tumbale, Master's Researcher San Francisco State University

## Dataset Summary

This data set is part of my master's thesis project investigating the correlation between microplastic abundance in Pacific mole crabs (*Emerita analoga*) and sanderling (*Calidris alba*) foraging behavior. Specifically, it contains measurements of microplastic abundance, recorded as percent cover of microplastics on a filter paper onto which particles were extracted from each crab, across multiple sites.

## Language

American English


## Data Fields

Site_Name - Name of the coastal site where the sample was collected.(e.g. Pescadero State Beach)

Crab ID - Unique identifier for each crab collected at each location. (e.g. HMB02.1, OB04.4)

Gut MP (% filter area) - Percentage of the filter area covered by microplastics, as observed on the filter paper containing particles extracted from the mole crab. (0-0.232)


## Dataset Creation

# Curation Rationale

This dataset was created to help aid the process of investigating the effects of microplastics on the foraging success of shorebirds. Quantifying microplastic abundance as percent cover on a filter provides a standardized metric for comparison across individuals and sites.

## Source Data

All data were collected firsthand as part of the master's thesis research work. I, along with a group of volunteer undergraduate student, performed allsampling, microplastic extraction, and data recording.

## Impact of Dataset

This dataset contributes to growing efforts in understanding how microplastic pollution affects coastal ecosystems, and specifically how it may influence prey availability for shorebirds through contamination of *Emerita analoga*. By quantifying microplastic presence in prey items, the dataset supports ecological research that may inform conservation strategies for shorebird species and environmental policies in pollution reduction.

## Discussion of Biases

Samples were collected from only three sites in Northern California and may not represent a broader geographic trend of microplastic pollution. This dataset was also collected in a limited period of time, so seasonal or long-term patterns could not be captured.
